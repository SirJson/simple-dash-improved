# simple-dash-improved

This is my personal fork of simple-dash where I want to give back some mods and improvements I thought are neat.

## How it is different from upstream

- Fork Awesome + Line Awesome instead of Font Awesome
  - The included version wasn't up to date at this point and having a free option seems to me the better choice
- Upgraded the JavaScript Syntax
  - It's 2020 and I can't think of any reason to install Internet Explorer
- Config is now saved and used locally
- Includes the Monaco Editor for Dashboard local customization

## Upcoming

- A Chrome / Firefox-like Online Search bar
- Fuzzy search icons and their class names inside the customization editor.
