# simple-dash-improved

This is my personal fork of simple-dash where I want to give back some of the mods and improvements I thought are neat.

## How it differs from upstream

- Fork Awesome instead of Font Awesome
  - The included version wasn't up to date at this point and having a free option seems to me the better choice
- Upgraded the Javascript Syntax
  - It's 2020 and I can't think of any reason to install Internet Explorer
- Config is now saved and used locally
  - It makes customizaion and offline usage possible. For now the config only saved locally and loaded locally

## Upcomming

- A Chrome / Firefox-like Online Searchbar
  - For me simple-dash replaces the new tab option and I always missed the direct search from that page
